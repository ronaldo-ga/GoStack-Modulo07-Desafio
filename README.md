# GoStack-Modulo07-Desafio
Mobile application made using React, React-Native, React-Redux and Redux-Saga.

### Prerequisites
You need to have react-native-cli installed in order to run this application. This can be achieved by running `yarn global add react-native-cli` from [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

You also need the Android SDK installed and proper configured. You can obtain the full Android Studio or only the SDK from this [page](https://developer.android.com/studio).


### Getting Started

##### • Run JSON Server:
This project was made using the [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create a fake database.

```json-server server.json --port 3333```

*Because react-native already runs at port 5555 you should set the port for 3333*

#### • Run react-native:
With your emulator open or cel phone connected run from the project root folder `react-native -run-android` for android or `react-native run-ios` for iOS.

You need to run this only once the second time you open your application you can only run `react-native start`
